# RaidZero-Testing-Board

This testing board is made from the HERO board by CTRE. You can check encoders, analog sensors, limit switches, and the PigeonIMU with this.
In addition, there is the ability to run both brushed and brushless motors.

CAD file also included in this repository [here](CAD/Testing%20Board.STEP).

## How to use

Plug a battery in and turn the main breaker switch on.
It will then boot up into a menu where you can scroll to select the modes. Once selected, press green button to enter the mode to start testing. Press the red button to exit the mode.

The red switch is for shutting of motors without shutting down the whole system.

Use the sliders to control the motor.
